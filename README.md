## **Introduction**
Welcome to my final project, ecommerce applications. This project was inspired by my eldest brothers passion for photography. Which gave me the inspiration to create a website for his photographs so that they can be accessed by different users. This will then enable my brothers photographs to reach a wider audience and give users to the ability to purchase copies of his photography.

In this README I will detail the steps I took to develop and create this project, with the use of  screen photos, images, links, charts and more.

This project is for educational purposes only.

Thank you for viewing my project.

### **Target Audience**
- People age 16 or older. 

- This website is not gender specific. 

- People who has a passion for photograpy.

- People who are into nature and outdoors.

- People from all around the world. 

- People with an eye for photograpy.

Other potential audience would be:

- People in need of a photographer for special events.

- Someone looking for a personal photographer.

- Likemind photographers.

##  **Marketing**

**Plan**

Aduj Visuals website is a business to customer e-commerce platform, created with the main aim for users to be able to purchase products as well as enable users to gain access to the portfolio. Other business oppotunites such as personally photograpy for companies as well as individuals.

To increase sales I implemented a marketing plan to ensure the website and photographs reaches a wider audience. I created a Facebook page as a marketing technique which will exhibit new photographs, information and news that is relevant to the website. 

Users are also able to sign up to the websites newsletter created using a custom model. This newsletter form is found in the footer of the website.

**FaceBook Page**

[Facebook page](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-5-E-commerce-Store/blob/main/media/340704067_186927914193896_3958745236801490948_n%20(1).png)





#### **Database**

The website uses Heroku and ElephantSQL Postgres relation database to store data. The project is consist of 8 models in total. The models are, Contact model, Newsletter model, Comment model, UserProfile model, Product model, Category model, OrderItem model and the Order model. These models are the key components of the website business goals and they also play a big role in improving the user experience. 

[Database Schema](https://github.com/Joha-will/aduj-visuals/blob/main/media/Screenshot%20(62).png)

#### **Fonts**

Google Fonts - Russo One
- This font was chosen because I think it goes well with the theme I was trying to create for the website. I think this font is also simple and legiable. This font was used throughout the entire website which changes in size and weight when utilized with different elements, such as a h1 tag or a p tag.

#### **Images**
The images used throughout this project came from my research online and as well as a few of my own. These images were picked to complement the website's information, and I thought they went well with the website's looks.



##  **Skeleton**
These wireframes were made during the planning stage to help me with the layout and design of specific page elements and content. They also assisted me in choosing how to implement particular functionalities. A few changes were made to the website during the development stages. A few things that changed were:

- During development, a home button was added to the navigation bar because I believed it would improve user experience if visitors could return to the home page from any page, if necessary.
- Pagination was added later during the development of the website, and it included buttons for consumers to utilise to navigate while viewing their bookings.

Use the link below to view the website's wireframes.

## **Surface**

### **Features**

#### **Home page**


**Navbar**

I have included a fixed navbar positioned at the top of the screen at all times. This enables the user to navigate easily throughout the website. This navbar is responsive on smaller screens as it collapses into a burger menu. 

The navbar is displayed on a laptop screen in two sections, in the top right of the page there is links to the users profile, basket and home page. In the centre below these links there are pages in relation to the gallery. 

On the smaller mobile screen, the burger menu is displayed in the top left with the navbar presented in one list. 

The basket icon shows how many products that are in the basket at one time. This ensures the user is aware of how many products they have in their basket at all times. 


**Logo** 
- This website has a logo which can be seen across all pages and it is full responsive. Click the link below to view the website logo.

[Image of website's Logo](https://github.com/Joha-will/aduj-visuals/blob/main/media/Screenshot%202023-07-01%20at%2011.10.40.png)

**Basket**

The basket pages displays all of the products added by the user. The information about each product is shown in a table with the product name, size, quantity, price and total. There is an option for the user to update the quantity within the table and also remove the product from the basket. At the bottom of the page there is a proceed to checkout button for the user. 

If there is no products currently in the basket a message is displayed that states ‘your basket is empty’.




**All Products**

The products sold by the gallery are all shown on this page. Every product has an image name, category, model, size and price. There is a view product button which takes you to the product detail page to view the item in a bigger display. 

[Image of Nav-bar Status](https://github.com/Joha-will/aduj-visuals/blob/main/media/Screenshot%202023-07-01%20at%2011.12.32.png)



**Footer**

The footer includes useful links and icons to the gallery’s social media pages such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Github. The footer also features as the newsletter subscription form. I wanted the user to be able to access this information at any time to encourage user engagement and gallery promotion. 

The footer also displays the copyrights information.



**User Profile**

A user who owns an account with the gallery when they are logged in they can access their customer information containing personal details including contact information and the users default address as well as their order history.

Within the personal details page the user is able to update their default shipping and billing address along with their contact information.

The order history displays a table of all the previous orders created by the user. This shows the order date, order number, quantity, size order total and product name.


**Delete booking Modal**

- The several page has a Modal which gets toggles when a user tries to delete/cancel a remove information from the website. The Modal challenges the user by asking the user to confirm that they want to delete something.

I also add a sitemaps.xlm, robots.txt, descriptive tags and rel attributes.




---

## **Deployment**

### **Using GitHub and GitPod**
The main branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

The following steps were used to create a repository, setup a workspace and use Github and Gipod.

- Click the Use this Template button.

- Give your repository a name, and description is you wish.

- Click the Create repository from template button to create your repository.

- Click the Gitpod button to create a Gitpod workspace, this could take a few minutes.

- When working on the project using Gitpod, it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod as this will open your previous workspace instead of creating a new one.

    - You can commit your work using the following commands:

        1. git add . - adds all updated files to a staging area.

        2. git commit -m " Add short message explaining your commit" - commits all changes to a local repository.

        3. git push - pushes all your commmited changes to your Github repository.

### **Forking the GitHub Repository**
By forking a GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository to your own GitHub account to view and make changes without making any changes to the original repository.

1. Log in to GitHub and local the GitHub repository.

2. At the top right of the page, locate "fork button" which is just below the bell icon.

3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### **Deployment to Heroku**

For the project to run on Heroku, there is a list of dependencies that needs to be installed before deploying the project.

First you need to install the support libraries:

- pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn

- pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2

- pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage

The list of dependencies goes into the requirements.txt file by using the following:

-  pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

Create your django project using the following:

- django-admin startproject YOURprojectname 

Then create an app using the following:

- python3 manage.py startapp YOURappname

Next add your app to the list of installed app in settings.py

- 'YOURappname'

Then you migrate the changes using the following:

- python3 manage.py migrate

Finally try opening your project in the browser using the following:

- python3 manage.py runserver

- Skeleton of the project should be up and running.

### **Linking to  a Heroku Database**

**Creating a Heroku account and Heroku app**

- Go to [Heroku.com](https://heroku.com/) and create an account.

- From the Heroku dashboard click Create New App button.

- Enter a name for the project and select your region.

- Click the Create App button.

**Creating a Database**

These steps will create a new PostgreSQL database instance for use with your project. If you don't have an ElephantSQL.com account yet, create one [Here](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
- Log in to ElephantSQL.com to access your dashboard.

- Click “Create New Instance”

- Set up your plan

- Give your plan a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)

- Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan

- You can leave the Tags field blank

**Create an env.py file**

Keeping things secret!

- In your project workspace, create a file called env.py. It’s a good idea to check that this file is included in the .gitignore file too. If you are using the Code Institute provided GitHub template, then the env.py file is already in the .gitignore file.

- In your env.py file add the following line of code. 
    - import os

- Next we need to set some environment variables. First, add a blank line, then set a DATABASE_URL variable, with the value you just copied from ElephantSQL as follows
    - os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURL>"
    - Replace <copiedURL> with the relevant string from ElephantSQL.
- As this is a Django application it has a SECRET_KEY, which it uses to encrypt session cookies. The secret key can be whatever you like.
We need to include this string in the env.py file. So, just like before, add the variable by pasting in the string as follows.
    - os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="my_super^secret@key"
    - We don't want to share our secrets either, so this documentation shows you a made up key. Just replace my_super^secret@key with your key
- Make sure you save the file.
This secret file isn’t much good on its own. Carry on to edit your settings.py file on the next page, including connecting up your workspace to the new database.

**Modifying settings.py**

- Now you have created an env.py file, you need to make your Django project aware of it. Open up your settings.py file and add the following code below your Path import
    - import os
    import dj_database_url
    if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
     import env
    - The if statement here acts as a little protection for the application in case you try to run it without an env.py file present. You will use the other import in a moment.
- A little further down, remove the insecure secret key provided by Django. Instead, we will reference the variable in the env.py file, so change your SECRET_KEY variable to the following
    - SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

- Now that is taken care of, we need to hook up your database. We are going to use the dj_database_url import for this, so scroll down in your settings file to the database section.Comment out the original DATABASES variable and add the code below, as shown
    - (# DATABASES = {
    (#     'default': {
    (#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
    (#         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    (#     }
    (# }
    
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
The code that has been commented out connects your Django application to the created db.sqlite3 database within your repo. However, as we know, that database is not suitable for production. This line of code separates the database URL stored by your env.py file into the relevant name and password etc.

- With those changes in place, make sure to save your file. Your application will now connect to your remote database hosted on ElephantSQL. Not convinced? Let’s prove it.Run the migration command in your terminal to migrate your database structure to the newly-connected ElephantSQL database
    - python manage.py migrate
Once the migrations have completed, head back over to your ElephantSQL dashboard, select your database instance and then select the “Browser” tab on the left.

Click “Table queries” to reveal a dropdown list, you can see your database structure here. You may not recognise all of the tables in the list, many are generated by the authorisation apps used, the important thing is that this list has been populated from your Django migrations.

- Take a moment to add, commit and push your project to GitHub if you haven’t done so already.

**Heroku Config Vars**
With a new database created and the settings.py file set up to connect to it, we will need to connect our new database to Heroku.

- Go back to the Heroku dashboard open the Settings tab

- Add two config vars:
    - DATABASE_URL, and for the value, copy in your database URL from ElephantSQL, no need to add quotation marks.
    - SECRET_KEY containing your secret key.
So now we have created and connected a remote database, configured our settings.py file (for now…) and created some secrets, we have a few more tasks to complete before we deploy. We’ll go through these in the next:

To improve compatibility with various Python libraries, we have updated the deployment template since this video was made. As a result, you must now add another Config Var in Heroku's Settings.
The key is PORT and the value is 8000



**Final Deployment**
